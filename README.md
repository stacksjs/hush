# Hush

> A modern macOS app that automatically detects when you're screen sharing and enables Do Not Disturb mode to protect your privacy.

## Features

- üéØ **Advanced Screen Sharing Detection** - Multiple detection methods for reliable operation
- üîï **Automatic Do Not Disturb** - Toggles Focus modes automatically when screen sharing starts/stops
- üîÑ **Background Operation** - Runs quietly in your menu bar
- üîî **Smart Notifications** - Notifies you when protection is enabled/disabled
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Settings** - Configure Focus modes, detection intervals, and more
- üìä **Usage Statistics** - Track how often you share your screen and for how long
- üöÄ **Auto Launch** - Optional startup at login
- üîí **Privacy Focused** - Works locally on your Mac with no data collection

## Enhanced Detection Methods

Hush uses multiple methods to reliably detect screen sharing:
- macOS built-in screen sharing status
- Active application detection for common screen sharing apps (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- Window monitoring for screen sharing indicators
- Screen capture state detection

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later (Ventura and above)
- Xcode 16.0 or later (for development)
- Swift 6.0

## Swift 6 Compatibility

Hush has been fully migrated to Swift 6, taking advantage of its new features:

- **Enhanced Safety**: Full data-race safety with strict concurrency checking
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimized memory management and execution
- **Modern Testing**: Using Swift's new Testing framework for comprehensive test coverage
- **Low-level Concurrency**: Leveraging the Synchronization library for thread safety

For developers working with this codebase, we've prepared a detailed [Swift 6 Migration Guide](.github/SWIFT6_MIGRATION.md) to help understand the changes and patterns used.

## Building

1. Open `Hush.xcodeproj` in Xcode 16 or later
2. Build and run the project

## Development

For detailed development information, please see our [Development Guide](.github/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs tests, linting, and build validation on every pull request and push to main
- **Release Workflow**: Builds, signs, notarizes, and releases the app when a new version tag is pushed

### Release Process

Our release process is automated using GitHub Actions and the [action-releaser](https://github.com/owner/action-releaser) GitHub Action:

1. Update the version in your project files and `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Create and push a new git tag (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`)
3. The Release workflow automatically:
   - Builds the macOS app
   - Creates a signed and notarized DMG
   - Creates a GitHub Release with the DMG attached
   - Updates the Homebrew formula (if configured)

The action-releaser provides flexible configuration options for customizing the release process. See the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file for details.

For more information on the release process, see the [Release Guide](.github/RELEASE.md).

## Usage

1. Hush runs in your menu bar
2. When screen sharing is detected, Do Not Disturb mode is automatically enabled
3. When screen sharing ends, Do Not Disturb mode is automatically disabled
4. Click the menu bar icon to access settings, statistics, and more

## Privacy

Hush only detects screen sharing state locally on your Mac and doesn't collect or transmit any data.

## Testing

```bash
swift test
```

You can also run the Xcode tests using:

```bash
cd Hush
xcodebuild test -project Hush.xcodeproj -scheme Hush
```
